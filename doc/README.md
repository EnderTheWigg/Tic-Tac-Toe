# TicTacToe-VSCode

This is a simple java game application used to explore both Java Swing and the minimax algorithm. 

Open and run in VSCode or other comptatible IDE

The game includes a way to play against yourself, as well as 3 ai difficulties. The "Perfect" AI was made with the minimax algorithm, and uses alpha beta pruning to improve efficency.

Enjoy,
